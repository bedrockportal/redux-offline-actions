# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save redux-offline-actions
```

or

```
$ yarn add redux-offline-actions
```

The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package provides a [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) build for use in Node.js, and with bundlers like [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). It also includes an [ES modules](http://jsmodules.io/) build that works well with [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) and [Webpack2](https://webpack.js.org)'s tree-shaking.

The [UMD](https://unpkg.com/redux-offline-actions@latest/dist) build exports a global called `window.ReduxOfflineActions` if you add it to your page via a `<script>` tag. We *donâ€™t* recommend UMD builds for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=redux).

## Usage

```js
import { handleActions, combineActions } from 'redux-actions'
import { createOfflineAction } from 'redux-offline-actions'

const defaultState = [];

const createTodo = createOfflineAction(
  'CREATE_TODO',
  text => text,
  text => {url: '/todo', method: 'post', args: {text}},
  'CREATE_TODO_COMMIT',
  'CREATE_TODO_ROLLBACK'
});

const reducer = handleActions({
  ['CREATE_TODO']: (state, { payload: { text } }) => [...state, text],

  ['CREATE_TODO_COMMIT']: (state, { meta: { text } }) => state.map(x => x === text ? {text, saved: true} : x),

  ['CREATE_TODO_ROLLBACK'] => (state, { meta: { text } }) => state.filter(x => x !== text)
}, defaultState);

export default reducer;
```
